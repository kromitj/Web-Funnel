## Building out a Web Funnel page
Scenario: We are generating user-specific referral code/links that can be sent via text. We would like our users to send their referral links out to their friends - but in order to measure direct download attribution from these links, we'll need to cross verify the new potential user's phone number in our web funnel with the phone number the user eventually signs up with (if they ever do sign up!).

## Assignment: We would like you to build out the below Web Funnel (wireframe provided) with the below functionality:
* "Download" button is not active until a valid phone number is typed into form field
* When "Download" button is pressed, call a placeholder function that sends the phone number to a [currently non-existent] backend endpoint
* Add an image box above the text in case we want to put in a logo
* Optimize for mobile experience, but make sure web does not look wonky


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
